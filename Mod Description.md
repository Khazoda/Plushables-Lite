# Why Plushables _Lite_? 🦧

- Plushables is a feature-rich plushie mod. It relies on multiple third party libraries to work.
- These libraries often take time to update to new versions of Minecraft when they're released.
- This pushes back Plushables' release date for each version.

**So, Plushables _Lite_ doesn't have any dependencies, will update quickly to each new version of Minecraft, and will receive Plushables content before the bigger Plushables mod?**

_Yes, yes and yes_.

Plushables _Lite_ exists as a functionally lightweight alternative to Plushables. Of course this means that some more complex features are cut for this version of the mod. See the _Cut Content_ section further down to see the differences.

🧨 If you'd rather install Plushables with all its bells and whistles, head over to [Plushables Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/plushables) and follow that description for installation instructions.

# That sounds good, but how do I install it? 🐸

Unlike Plushables, Plushables _Lite_ is incredibly easy to install. It has no dependencies you need to download, so just download a version of this mod for your Minecraft version, make sure Fabric or Quilt is installed, and play!

# Getting Started 📖

Plushables _Lite_ does away with the Builder block, and instead lets you craft plushies straight from a crafting table. Make some Hearts of Gold and start crafting! All plushie recipes are unlocked in your vanilla Minecraft recipe book once you craft a Heart of Gold - alternatively use a recipe viewer mod like EMI, REI or JEI to search up the recipes you want.
