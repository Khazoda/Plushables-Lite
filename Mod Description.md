# Why Plushables _Lite_? 🦧

- Plushables is a feature-rich plushie mod. It relies on multiple third party libraries to work.
- These libraries often take time to update to new versions of Minecraft when they're released.
- This pushes back Plushables' release date for each version.

This means that Plushables _Lite_

- has **zero** extra dependencies
- will update quickly to each new version of Minecraft
- will receive Plushables content before the bigger Plushables mod

Plushables _Lite_ exists as a functionally lightweight alternative to Plushables. This means that some more complex features are cut for this version of the mod. See the _Cut Content_ section further down to see the differences.

🧨 If you'd rather install Plushables with all its bells and whistles, head over to [Plushables Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/plushables) and follow that description for installation instructions.

# That sounds good, but how do I install it? 🐸

Unlike Plushables, Plushables _Lite_ is incredibly easy to install. With no third party dependencies it only requires Fabric/Quilt & Fabric API/Quilted Fabric API to work. Most modern modded launchers (e.g. Modrinth, CurseForge, Prism Launcher) will make this process very trivial.

# Getting Started 📖

Plushables _Lite_ does away with the Builder block, and instead lets you craft plushies straight from a crafting table. Make some Hearts of Gold and start crafting! All plushie recipes are unlocked in your vanilla Minecraft recipe book once you craft a Heart of Gold - alternatively use a recipe viewer mod like EMI, REI or JEI to search up the recipes you want.

Check out the advancements page (press 'L' by default) for simple prerequisites to unlocking recipes.

# Transition existing world to or from Plushables 🌏

Although it is not strictly recommended, it _is_ possible to change your world from Plushables to Plushables Lite or vice versa. This change is tested on every new version, but no guarantees can be made, so **!!BACK UP YOUR WORLD!!** before trying this.

Do the following steps _before_ changing from one mod to another in your world to make the transition as smooth as possible:

## Plushables → Plushables _Lite_

- Take items out of Plushable Builders **before** swapping to Plushables _Lite_ (items will be lost otherwise)
- ALWAYS make a world backup incase things go wrong
- Swap Plushables mod jar file for Plushables _Lite_ mod jar file

## Plushables _Lite_ → Plushables

- Take note of where your powered plushables are - they will appear invisible after swapping mods, and will be hard to find otherwise.
- ALWAYS make a world backup incase things go wrong
- Swap Plushables _Lite_ mod jar file for Plushables mod jar file
- Right click powered plushables (will be invisible on first world load after mod change)
